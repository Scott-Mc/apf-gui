APF GUI
=============

##Overview

APF GUI is a free, open source WHM plugin cPanel that allows you to manage your APF firewall from within WHM.  It presently has support for,

- Managing the APF configuration.
- Managing the allowed IP file.
- Managing the denied IP file.

### Requirements

 - Perl 5.8 or better
 - APF (Advanced Policy Firewall) from R-fx networks (http://www.rfxn.com/downloads/apf-current.tar.gz)

### Security

We have developed this plugin with security in mind,  only authorized (root) users may use the interface,  only permitted files are allowed to be viewed/modified,  owners of files are checked and error checking in is place.   The cPanel logging library has been used and any malicious attempts are reported at /usr/local/cpanel/logs/error_log
